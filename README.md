## Moosend Features

Moosend packs a lot of useful features into a simple dashboard that’s easy to navigate. It’s built to help you send better emails, save time with automation, and track everything so you know what’s working. Here’s a look at the main features:

**1. Drag-and-Drop Email Editor**

<a href="https://afftrend.com/moosend">
  <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1wzdHJQZQ_GCZpPkvxLTaaggJ4IX1D3wP" width="800px" alt="">
</a>

This tool lets you build emails by dragging and dropping blocks like text, images, buttons, and social icons — no coding needed. It’s like building with LEGO. You can create great-looking emails even if you’ve never done it before.

**2. Ready-to-Use Templates**

<a href="https://afftrend.com/moosend">
  <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1d2csieruWxV7VvEEKMNFLBkWJOyFujRn" width="800px" alt="">
</a>

Moosend gives you pre-designed email layouts for common tasks like welcoming new subscribers, announcing sales, or sending newsletters. You can pick one and customize it to fit your brand, saving time and effort.

**3. Marketing Automation**

<a href="https://afftrend.com/moosend">
  <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1GtbHpO6wMH-FYJt_JLvaB-PQRNKjwDwJ" width="800px" alt="">
</a>

This is like setting your emails on autopilot. You can create workflows that send emails automatically based on what people do. For example:

* When someone signs up, they get a welcome email.
* If they leave items in their cart, they get a reminder.
* After a purchase, they get a thank-you email or review request.

It saves you from doing everything manually.

**4. Advanced Segmentation**

This helps you send the right email to the right people. Instead of emailing everyone the same thing, you can group your audience based on their actions (like what they clicked on, bought, or how often they open emails). This leads to higher open rates and better results.

**5. Real-Time Analytics**

<a href="https://afftrend.com/moosend">
  <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1rL_yTmhVIIGCkjSs_CqneY0xjoZpKTgt" width="800px" alt="">
</a>

Once you send your email, you can track how it’s doing. You’ll see who opened it, clicked links, or unsubscribed — all in real-time. This helps you understand what works and what doesn’t, so you can improve over time.

**6. A/B Testing**

<a href="https://afftrend.com/moosend">
  <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1tAVycm33m1TJMTCoU4HxasdssYpjijBc" width="800px" alt="">
</a>

Also called split testing, this feature lets you test two versions of the same email to see which performs better. For example, you can test:

* Two subject lines
* Different images or headlines
* Different call-to-action buttons
  Moosend sends both versions to a small group and picks the winner to send to the rest.

**7. Landing Page Builder**

<a href="https://afftrend.com/moosend">
  <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1xlYcQcsAxDJwytsiTSh_IiVttGGdC5Ma" width="800px" alt="">
</a>

Besides emails, you can also build landing pages — single pages designed to promote a product, capture leads, or run campaigns. You can build them with the same drag-and-drop style, no design experience needed.

**8. Sign-Up Forms**

These are forms you add to your website to collect email addresses. You can make them pop up, slide in, or stay fixed on a page. Moosend lets you design and customize these forms to match your website’s style.

**9. eCommerce AI Features**

If you run an online store, Moosend can track what your customers do (like what they view or buy) and send smart recommendations. For example, if someone looked at running shoes, Moosend can send them an email showing more shoe options — all automatically.

**10. Integrations**

<a href="https://afftrend.com/moosend">
  <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1J5KVTzipbWG3aG6J7zEZqIkt_tDYzSUH" width="800px" alt="">
</a>

Moosend connects with other tools you might already use — like Shopify, WordPress, Zapier, or Google Analytics. This means your systems work together smoothly, without needing extra manual work.

**11. GDPR & CAN-SPAM Compliance**

Moosend helps you stay within the rules for email marketing. You can add unsubscribe links, collect permission properly, and handle data requests — all of which are required by privacy laws like GDPR and CAN-SPAM.

These features are designed to make your email marketing more effective while saving you time and effort. Whether you're just starting or already have experience, Moosend gives you the tools you need to grow.
